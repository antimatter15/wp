		<description><![CDATA[I have no formal training in computer science, didn&#039;t learn until about a year ago what an API was or why reverse engineering everything wasn&#039;t the right way to do stuff, and you&#039;ve done exactly what I would have done. When I read about people&#039;s adventures doing formal programmer things like following design patterns and nitpicking about the complexities of OOP design, I am at a loss. Yet when I read this, I can see myself doing the same things. Right down to using smsniff. It might be more appropriate to read API documentation and develop RESTful interfaces for clients (or do we call them &quot;guests&quot; now?) to curate their webbings, but reverse engineering stuff written by giants like Google is FUN. Respect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello! Quick question that&#039;s totally off topic. Do you know how to make your site mobile 
friendly? My weblog looks weird when viewing from my iphone4.
I&#039;m trying to find a template or plugin that might 
be able to resolve this issue. If you have any suggestions, please share.
Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love your blog and find most of your post&#039;s 
to be what precisely I&#039;m looking for. can you offer guest 
writers to write content for yourself? I wouldn&#039;t mind composing 
a post or elaborating on a lot of the subjects you write in relation to here.
Again, awesome blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well i found this page after running into the whole chrome packaged app thingy and it was demonically confusing as to why Google would produce something that cumbersome, so i decided to find out if it was just me being lazy or too stupid to recognize a brilliant idea when i saw one but thank God i found this page now i know am not. The whole thing just reminds me of windows 8 and the whole metro nonsense. As a wannabe web developer this packaged thingy seems like deploying an application on a server, as if that&#039;s not hard enough why would i bother with this]]></description>

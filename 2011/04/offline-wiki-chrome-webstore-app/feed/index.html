		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Why do I keep getting referrer clicks from here, to my Start page extension, even though I don&#039;t see any links on this page (that would lead there)? It&#039;s so strange I had to ask :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very nice. And seeing, as you said, Wikipedia contains almost all human knowledge, this is great for school projects or simple research on the go. However, my only concern is, what if someone edits a Wikipedia document? How long will it take for this new Wikipedia document to be uploaded to your server and available for Offline Wiki?

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been using this MP3 player in my CR-48 using a SanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC card that has about 15 Gigs of MP3s in individual folders and the player reads the folders perfectly including nested folders too. However I have noticed for some reason not related to MP3 tags or anything else I can find, It appears that some of the songs will have a random 3 letter song name instead of the real name. It will be the same for the all the songs on that album. For instance all songs will &quot;rtl&quot; or &quot;pex&quot; ect... It only does this on about 100 files out of the 2000. Any ideas on how to fix this on my end? Or, is this some bug that needs to be worked out in the code? Thanks in advance]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dearest Admin,

I&#039;ve been stalking through your blog during third period on December 12th, 2011 (It&#039;s alright, I&#039;m not ditching, I just happen to have finished all my work and this is computer graphics. I&#039;m not a stalker either, you sent me this link before I believe and you helped me with my less-than-amazing-geometry-skillz).
So!
Why-are-you-so-good-at-coding-I-can&#039;t-believe-you-said-you-fail-you-horribly-amazing-coding-person. It&#039;s confusing, because I don&#039;t get anything :D. I&#039;m oh-so terribly stupid, after all.  But I want an explanation, and teach me~  And that Ajax Animator, can you explain using non-computer-fluent language? 

Sincerly,
Your fellow reject, Sui.]]></description>

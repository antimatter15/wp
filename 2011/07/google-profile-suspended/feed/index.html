		<description><![CDATA[What creates a bad atmosphere in social networks is not pseudonymity but lack of consequences. If someone is clearly dedicated to their pseudonymous (or otherwise) persona then they will behave at least as well (and sometimes better) than if they were going by their &#039;real name&#039; (not that such a thing exists in law in a number of countries - you have the right to be known as whatever you like).

So the correct answer is not to enforce &#039;real names&#039;, but to measure engagement with the network under whatever name is being used and make that transparent to the end users.  Stackoverflow and reddit do the right kind of thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google is in the wrong.  They screwed me in the days of Orkut way before you hahahh.  But they rectified the situation.  There&#039;s a very good chance they&#039;ll fix this.
Recently, Orkut account was once again disabled for no apparent reason, so they still have a lot to learn about running a social network.
Still, what they do is 100x better than Facebook.  Zuck is yuck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[re: “You have nothing to be afraid of if you have nothing to hide”
Well, perhaps (nothing wrong with having something to hide), but anyway ... even if there isn&#039;t something to hide or be afraid of, there can still be something to be irritated, annoyed and perhaps even angry about.
We aren&#039;t free because we can prove that we have nothing to fear, we are free because we don&#039;t have to - &#039;they&#039; have no power over us except that which is surrendered.

re: G+ not having pseudonyms ... Google Profiles existed for a long while before G+, allowed pseudonyms and have been imported automatically, not optionally. ;-)
I am strongly in favour of allowing people to have a separate profile name for specific circles where people might not know them by their common public-internet name (eg me)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a petition here for the pseudonym part:  http://www.change.org/petitions/google-inc-google-needs-to-allow-pseudonyms-on-services-like-google-for-anonymity

Sadly, it&#039;s not getting much support yet - under 1000 names still.

PS. I&#039;m suspended for my pseudonym as well - http://iconoclasm2000.blogspot.com/2011/07/google-suspended.html

I&#039;ve been Dark Star since 2006 and I blog semi-anonymously as I have received death threats]]></description>

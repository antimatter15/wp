		<description><![CDATA[very cool. maybe the error is from the thickness of the mirror, with a charge in angle caused by the index of refraction of the glass? pretty cool you were able to make a fudge factor equation.

what if you mixed this idea with the laser light plane? You could have two extremely cheap (2 USD where I live) lasers shining from the diagonal corners? Maybe just some bright IR leds?

 I could imagine things would get more difficult to track if there were lots of fingers of the same color in there if you&#039;re just using color.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello!
Sorry, haven&#039;t checked your answers for several days.
The set of features of http://jsvectoreditor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html is almost what we need.
The only thing missing is a free pencil, but I&#039;m not sure this feature can be implemented with SVG.

In any case, I have noticed some minor behavioral issues. Will you be interested in fixing and stabilizing the code for money?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just tried using svg-edit with svgweb again with the most recent trunk editions of both. Sadly, while svgweb has progressed significantly, for instance, it&#039;s now possible to programatically insert svg elements with javascript, something which was not available during the original port, which led to me making a hack (having the the svg element exist before in HTML). Sadly, the progress of svgweb has been outmatched by the improvements done to svg-edit, which now requires several features not implemented in svgweb. Mostly, the including of a svg element within another svg element, which powers zoom and layers. So, at current states, its still not possible to do the integration. Maybe some time later, it will be possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried working on it recently, and SVG web has really improved since, but http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/issues/detail?id=417 needs to be implemented (though I might be able to continue using the js-based hackish partial implementation that I have there).

If you don&#039;t need as fully featured an editor as svg-edit, I have this http://code.google.com/p/jsvectoreditor/ which works in IE and modern browsers, but its significantly less powerful.]]></description>

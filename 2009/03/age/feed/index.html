		<description><![CDATA[Hooray, I&#039;m not even that old!

...you&#039;re still doing a great job. It&#039;s quite hard to believe that even with the accomplishments you have had at the time you posted this, you unfortunately didn&#039;t qualify for a school I live 14.94 miles away from (measured as the crow flies). Even still, you&#039;re at the skill level of many college students and above (though you&#039;re not far from that now) and producing cool things for the community. You inspire me to work on some of the silly projects that I try to make and can only hope to make a reality. Thanks.

I guess I&#039;ll help work on ShinyTouch if I learn Python in the next couple of years, because it&#039;s a really cool concept and I&#039;d like to see it complete and ready for anyone to use. (Problem: most laptops, which are what most people have, have cameras mounted above the monitor screen.) Sorry to bother you, this is one of the only times I&#039;ve seen a teenager doing this stuff and I&#039;ve used several of your projects before, and that was a surprise. Bye...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is really cool. I run an Awarding Body with qualifications for students that produce work for the benefit of the community. Yours is way ahead of what would be needed for a distinction or A* GCSE equivalent.  If your school co-operated you could get the qualification pretty easily and we&#039;d do it for free because your work would be an excellent example for other students.]]></description>

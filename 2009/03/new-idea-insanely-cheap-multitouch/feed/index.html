		<description><![CDATA[Well, I think ambient light should perfectly suffice. If anything, a piece of cardboard on the left and bottom. And I think the camera could exist anywhere in front of the monitor. The angles of the mirrors can be calculated to have the camera at just about any position]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If your mirrors are top and right, you might need a row of LED&#039;s on the bottom and left to make it easier to track from your camera/optical sensor.

The problem is that you would need your camera to be directly behind the user, so the mirrors could reflect the touches properly. That would wreck your overall image processing.

I think there may be some temporary solutions that help us develop the apps and UI for multitouch, but ultimately I think we&#039;ll be able to buy a huge sheet of acrylic with a USB cable that will plug into our pc&#039;s. Hang it on the wall, calibrate the corners, and you&#039;re in business.

The technology is available, it just needs to be implemented as an input device for PC&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great! I love Python and I love Linux. I&#039;m also very interested in multitouch, so I&#039;m glad you&#039;re into it, trying to make it easier to set up. You should put up some pictures of your rig when you have it. And show us videos when you&#039;ve got something to show. And put up the source so we can test and maybe even improve.

I came to this site from PyMT (Python Multitouch) I think. Although I don&#039;t remember, I was surfing last night and left some tabs open :p]]></description>

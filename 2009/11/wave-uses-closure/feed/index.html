		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Wave is GWT, but they seem to also use Closure which makes me believe part of the reason Closure was released is because Wave uses it and will be open sourced too.

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t Wave coded in GWT? It seems like Lars stated this directly at i/o 2009 dev preview.
It also obfuscate code quite well.
But the structure should be very different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just went to see if you had any progress with your projects(mainly ajaxanimator) and I saw your post. about closure. I just want to say thanks because I always wanted to get into google wave and see how do they do a lot of things(to learn for my OS) and I found out they are using closue which I had o idea what it was until now.

So Thanks!]]></description>

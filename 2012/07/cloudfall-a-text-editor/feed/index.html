		<description><![CDATA[This sounds(and looks) pretty awesome!
I used SourceKit for a long while, but sadly it&#039;s no longer being updated. Aside from the off-line functionality, the one thing I *really* want in a text editor is Google Drive support. That&#039;s the key thing for me. I&#039;ve been looking all over, but the problem is that I also want this as something I can use inside of Chrome so that it&#039;s on every computer I use; I&#039;m all for web-based software and SourceKit was even better because it was in Chrome and just saved to Dropbox. No messing about at all.

If you&#039;d be willing to release this as a Chrome app, I&#039;d definitely use it. If you could do that *and* add Drive support, I&#039;d absolutely be willing to buy it or send a donation.
Really, I&#039;m looking for SourceKit plus off-line and Drive support. This sounds ideal to me.]]></description>

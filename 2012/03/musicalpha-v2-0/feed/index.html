		<description><![CDATA[And now 2.2 is broken. I believe BlobBuilder is removed from Chrome. I believe line id3v2.js:433 is throwing an exception. If you could please confirm that the problem is a change in Chrome and not a change in the Music API, then I may try to fix the problem, unless you have a quicker fix.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey!

I loved this app when it worked as I&#039;m big on google music and only have a chromebook?  Is this app still working? I tried and does not work for me. It may be becuase I am on the dev channel using Aura? What do you think? Regardless thank you so much for your work on this project]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This stuff is way over my head, but I still wanted to say well done!  I found this blog post after Paul Irish shared it on G+ and I immediately tried MusicAlpha 2.2.  It worked flawlessly, and the smooth animation was quite pleasing.  I&#039;m not sure how much response you get for creating stuff like this, but, for what it&#039;s worth, I think it&#039;s wonderful.

Thank you...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came here after following a link on of your github repositories. This blog post fascinated me for lots of reasons. A lot of the other posts look interesting too. I want to read more of them (but it is late -- I will return tomorrow). I can only imagine what an interesting person you must be.

Anyways, I originally came here to thank you for sharing your javascript animated gif making code. It was exactly what I needed for a little project I wanted to do for a long time. I feared I had to dive into the GIF specifications (which are surprisingly simply I have found by the way!) and do a lot of bit/ byte fiddling. Using your repo I finished what I wanted in 4 hours. So thanks for saving me many hours of work. It was not particularly well documented, but you had plenty of demo code (which wasn&#039;t the most formal, but clear enough to get what is going on).



By the way, you are way behind on your one-post-per-month quota!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! Microwave is the first really useable Wave client that is build on the new Google Wave API. I worked on it too for my app Waveboard, but since Google seems to drop Wave I discontinued the work on it.

Sadly I found a bug that makes the version on my iPhone 3GS unusable. It seems the WebView is not sized correctly. See this screenshot for details: http://skitch.com/holtwick/due2x/screenshot-2010.08.23-21.27.01]]></description>

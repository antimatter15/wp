		<description><![CDATA[The great thing now is that I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being bottlenecked at all by the python (except my blob detection code, that needs replacing). My camera only handles about 30 frames per second, and with all the code running, I still get about 30 frames per second. What&#039;s annoying is that even though OpenCV does things like face detection, it doesn&#039;t come with a blob detection solution built in :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very interesting approach! Python is by far the best programming language ever but maybe for time critical task as computer visioning a language like C or some other compiled language might be the better choice. But if you like it very portable something based on the Java or .net/Mono runtime might also be an adequate choice. For both with JPython and IronPython ports these runtime environments exist, but I&#039;m not sure how about OpenCV. I personally played around with OpenCV on iPhone OS using Objective-C. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVJj4jEu0vU

It is really amazing what can be accomplished with computer visioning these days :) Keep up your various researches.]]></description>

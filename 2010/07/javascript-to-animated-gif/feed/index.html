		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m truly enjoying the design and layout of your site. It&#039;s a very easy on the eyes which makes it much 
more pleasant for me to come here and visit more often.
Did you hire out a developer to create your theme?
Exceptional work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all I would like to say excellent 
blog! I had a quick question that I&#039;d like to ask if you do not mind.
I was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your head 
prior to writing. I&#039;ve had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out.
I do take pleasure in writing but it just seems like the 
first 10 to 15 minutes are generally lost just trying to figure 
out how to begin. Any ideas or hints? Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An easy way to grab frames from canvas animations is to use the JavaScript console built into your browser. There is an article on Stack Overflow titled &quot;grabbing-each-frame-of-an-html5-canvas&quot; that demonstrates how to do this, but the basic principle is that the toDataURL() method allows you to access a single instance of the canvas image and this can then be written back to the browser as an image. To capture a complete sequence, the SetInterval() method can be used.]]></description>

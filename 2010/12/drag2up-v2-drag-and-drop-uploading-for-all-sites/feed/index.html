		<description><![CDATA[Hey buddy,

at first I&#039;m sorry for writing you from this email service, but currently I&#039;m at work and they are blocking all email services except for this one. Anyway.

What I wanted you to know, is that your Chrome extension just saved my life.

You have to know that my company is blocking 99% of the stuff on the internet that&#039;s got nothing to do with work. e.g. we can&#039;t download simple .zip or .rar files. How stupid is that? Can you imagine??

So the only option left for me was to bypass this bloackage via Dropbox, since curiously enough downloading any file from Dropbox is possible...

For some time now I&#039;ve been using this service (https://www.sidecloudload.com/) to remotley get the files and transfer them to my Dropbox. 

But the problem is, that this service has many flaws and often isn&#039;t able to transfer the files since it can&#039;t determine the filesize and so on.

However now that I tried your extension I&#039;m in heaven. I can just right click any file and send it to my dropbox, flawlessly so far.. GREAT!

One thing that annoys me though is the fact, that your extension just stores everything in the Dropbox root folder and therefore has read/write access to the entire Dropbox.

I&#039;d prefer that Cloud Save puts the stuff I upload to a seperate folder and only has write access to this folder. Why does it need read access anyway?

I would really love to see this feature added!!!#]]></description>

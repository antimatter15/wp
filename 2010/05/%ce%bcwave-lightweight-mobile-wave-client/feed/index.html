		<description><![CDATA[This project is very useful, I&#039;m loving going through your code!

Is there a querystring option tu turn off the inbox when this is viewed from a larger (laptop) client? Or, a way to show a specific wave?  I know this can also be done via the embed API, but I prefer some of your features.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh wow, that is quite impressive.  I don&#039;t really know how I found your blog, but you do a fair bit of technological feats and have very few commenter&#039;s.  So let me at least say good job.

I&#039;d recommend polishing up the application a fair bit (maybe wait for the API update) and then send it in to Lifehacker for some recognition.  Gina is big on Wave, and I&#039;m sure she&#039;d love to feature the first user-made wave client.]]></description>

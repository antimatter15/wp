		<description><![CDATA[OnlyPaths is very powerful, but it&#039;s quite buggy. and there are some design flaws of OnlyPaths (inherent from RichDraw). The biggest being the fact most actions are done in the renderer, including the user-interactions. and it shouldn&#039;t be that way, you end up doing the same thing over and over again, so the final product is glitchy and inconsistant.

It&#039;s not going to replace onlypaths. And I did it basically because I&#039;ve been interested in such, because OnlyPaths is overly-complicated.]]></description>

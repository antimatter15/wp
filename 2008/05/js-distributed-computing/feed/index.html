		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post, thanks. I&#039;ve been thinking about this problem also, and wonder if a site for the purposes of rating/reviewing compute snippets would help encourage take-up (presently one issue is the security problems associated with running JavaScript from anonymous sources). In general, I think this is a hugely under-explored topic, and wonder what the blockers are to getting more activity around it?

Aside: if you&#039;re not already aware, the links to your demo are broken. When starting the demo, I get &quot;NetworkError: 504 Gateway Time-out - http://antimatter15.110mb.com/misc/distcrack/work.php?undefined&quot;, and when getting stats, I get &quot;TypeError: _d.d is undefined&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, this is exactly what I was looking for.
Did you contact anyone from Boinc (SETI@home etc...) and tell them about your script ?
It could increase the performance by a thousandfold at least.
Boinc average being 2.6 PFLOPS at the moment.]]></description>

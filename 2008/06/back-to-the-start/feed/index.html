		<description><![CDATA[Before, i had this client-side way (doesn&#039;t work in ie) to convert SVG-&gt;WHATWG Canvas-&gt;JPG/PNG. There&#039;s also this program (in PHP, so it may not be of use to you) VectorConverter,  that does the same.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very interested in your work, it is truly amazing what you can do these days on the web. 

I&#039;m not sure if you guys are open for new ideas, kind of adjusting what you already have made with the onlypaths project to fit the printing industry..

See I&#039;ve been going crazy trying to find a graphic editing tool to work online to utilize on my printing websites.

I&#039;m developing a shoppingcart system that sells printing products like business cards, postcards, etc...
One thing that I&#039;m falling behind on if I want to compete with todays Online Printing websites like www.vistaprint.com or www.buildasign.com 
I need to have an online graphic editing tool and what captured me about your project is that you guys have the tool but you are utilizing it for anamation like Flash instead of Photoshop.


My question is:
Is it possible to take SVG output generated by onlypaths and render it into a PDF, or a JPG.

If so, will you guys be interested in working on the project to get onlypaths to fit what I&#039;ve described.

I&#039;ll be willing to fund the project, I know that this is not what you intended to do when you started this project but I can assure you that if you do so It will make you the 1st in the industry to offer such a tool.

I&#039;ll be looking forward to hearing from you &quot;Admin&quot; and josep_ssv.

Great work guys, I really think you are creating something that Is going to be the next big thing on the web.

Thanks,
Rami
